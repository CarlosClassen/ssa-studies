# SSA-Studies
Used to organize our group project in 'Software System Architectures' at CU Prague. In this project, we implement a part of a student information system - the project management module.

## Project (PRO)
The project module in our software architecture makes it possible to create teams and projects in the student information system and thus organise students into workgroups. 

This is useful, when group work is to be completed in courses. In this case, all the work to be completed can be created as projects and students can be grouped together out of a course list to carry them out.

### Stakeholders
